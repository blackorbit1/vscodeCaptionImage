# VSCode Image Preview Extension

The VSCode Image Preview Extension aims to streamline the process of working with paired image-caption datasets in Visual Studio Code. It automatically displays the corresponding image when a text caption file is opened, providing a clear and immediate visual context for the data you're working with.

## Feature

- Automatic image preview: The extension works in the background, automatically displaying the associated image whenever a `.txt` caption file is opened. The image will appear in a new pane on the right.

-> The extension is compatible with multiple image file formats, including `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, and `.webp`.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+P` to open the quick open dialog.
3. Type `Open Image Preview` and press `Enter`.

## How to Use

Once installed, the extension will automatically function whenever a `.txt` caption file is opened. The corresponding image (if it exists and is in one of the supported formats) will be displayed in a new pane on the right.
